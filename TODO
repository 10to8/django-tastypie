TODO
====


- XML serialization/deserialization is not implemented and needs to be a
  high priority.
- Finish the ``ModelRepresentation`` implementation.
    - FK/M2M representation fields.
    - ForeignKey/ManyToManyField are do-able, but require either the registry
      pattern or overriding the representation. There should also be a way to
      control "depth" (if sub-representations are allowed to traverse their
      relations).
- Registry for the full API to make the complete Barkeeper's Friend possible.
- Authentication
    - ``OauthAuthentication``
    - ``APIKeyAuthentication``
- Implement throttling.
- Implement API keys/tokens.
- Documentation.
