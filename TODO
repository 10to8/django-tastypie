TODO
====

To demo-able:
-------------

- Finish the ``ModelRepresentation`` implementation.
    - CRUD methods should be simple, relying on data to be pre-populated.
    - The ``dehydrate/hydrate`` should be called as soon/late as possible
      to make sure the representation is fully populated for serialization.
    - ForeignKey/ManyToManyField are do-able, but require either the registry
      pattern or overriding the representation. There should also be a way to
      control "depth" (if sub-representations are allowed to traverse their
      relations).
- Re-integrate the changes from the above into ``Resource``.
- Finish serialization bits.
    - Implement the simple case for all.
    - Serialize either a list or an object.
    - Make sure the representation (specifically the ``dehydrate``) is what is
      handed to the serializer, so that more complex things are possible.
- Tests.
- Examples.


Longer-term:
------------

- Registry for the full API to make the complete Barkeeper's Friend possible.
- FK/M2M representation fields.
- Authentication
    - Maybe not subclass but provide a delegate?
    - ``AuthenticatedResource``
    - ``DjangoAuthResource``
    - ``OauthResource``
- Implement throttling.
- Implement API keys/tokens.
- Documentation.
