To demo-able:
-------------

- Tests.
- Examples.


Longer-term:
------------

- XML serialization/deserialization is not implemented and needs to be a
  high priority.
- ``Resource`` needs to do content-type negotiation on the PUT/POST data.
- Finish the ``ModelRepresentation`` implementation.
    - ForeignKey/ManyToManyField are do-able, but require either the registry
      pattern or overriding the representation. There should also be a way to
      control "depth" (if sub-representations are allowed to traverse their
      relations).
- Registry for the full API to make the complete Barkeeper's Friend possible.
- FK/M2M representation fields.
- Authentication
    - Maybe not subclass but provide a delegate?
    - ``AuthenticatedResource``
    - ``DjangoAuthResource``
    - ``OauthResource``
- Implement throttling.
- Implement API keys/tokens.
- Documentation.
